# MysitemywayShortcodes
A (hacky) plugin that reproduces the shortcodes for mysitemyway themes. Tested on Echelon 2.4.

Our team built this plugin because we were changing themes away from a a Mysitemyway Premium Wordpress Theme. The mysitemyway.com site is no longer live as of 12/16/2015. The client had used the shortcodes to format a lot of content throughout the site. It would have been time consuming to reformat the content, so we pulled the shortcode code from the theme and made it into this plugin.

The theme seemed to be well made, but it was ill advised to integrate the formatting part of the theme itself.

Since there is no documentation, I would advise against using this plugin to add shortcodes to your site if you were not already using them in a Mysitemyway theme.

We will try to clean this code up a bit and add some basic docs over time, but no gauruntees. It does work on a live site that was previously running the Echelon theme.

Good luck!
